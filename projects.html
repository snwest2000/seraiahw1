    <h1>Projects</h1>


    <p>Project 1: "Video as a Cultural Critique"</p>
    <p>This project focused on the concept of copyright and the usage of artists and creators using copywritten music.</p>

<p>Project 2: "Installation"</p>
<p>This project focused on the concept of projection. I wanted to show my passion for Marvel films and the characters by drawing them as each of them were killed by Thanos.</p>

<p>Project 3: "Critical Interactivity"</p>
<p>This project focused on the concept of netart and my first internet memory. I wanted to show how my somewhat conservative Christian parents saw YouTube and the alternative rock music I listened to as kid (and to this day).</p>

<p>Final Project: "Stan Lee / Jack Kirby Tribute"</p>
<p>The concept I am exploring in this video is go further and pushing my project from Project 2 (projection). I used Sofia Cordova's video as a reference to my project when adding video and photo layers on top of my video project. This video projection is supposed to be a tribute to Stan Lee (and Jack Kirby), who recently passed away on November 12th. I wanted to show how Stan Lee's legacy had an impact on my life and other fans.</p>
