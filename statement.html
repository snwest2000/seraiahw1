        <h1>Artist Statement</h1>

          <p>My name is Seraiah and I’m a visual artist. I’ve been drawing ever since I could pick up a pen. With art, I’m passionate about what I’m doing during the process, making sure every little detail is right and people seeing and appreciating that dedication is why I’m passionate about art. If you’re not passionate about what you’re doing, then there’s no purpose in doing it.
</p>
          <p>As a nerd, my art reflects what I’m passionate about, which is comics, anime, and other things related to pop culture. In each of the projects we’ve worked on in this class, I show all of my passions and interests and who I am as person. Pop culture has had a huge impact on who I am as a person and as an artist.
